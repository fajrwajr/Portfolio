              <p>Good: I liked this project because it gave me a better understanding of how arrays and objects work. I liked being able to add my creative element to the story.</p>
              <p>Bad: I used NodeJS and Express for the registration and login. I encountered some difficulty with COR errors for different reasons, either because the endpoint didnâ€™t exist, or my ports weren't public.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Good: For this project, I used NodeJS and Express also. I decided to do an e-commerce site and used an API (Stripe) to process payments.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Bad: When I was integrating the Stripe API into my project, I had a hard time with the uuid library because it was deprecated, so I had to upgrade the library and write it into my code a different way.</p>

              <p class="card-text">GOOD: I love this project and I felt it took me to another level in my coding. For the registration and login, I used Python/Flask to sign and login users, and I used JWT to redirect users to the protected pages when logging in. My favorite feature was the "Add a Birthdate". When you add a birthdate, you get an alert to your email (using Sendgrid) reminding you to send a gift card.</p>
              <p>Honorable Mentions: I learned a lot from these errors with this project. The hardest thing about this project was using the Python datetime library to work the way I wanted it to with the "Add a Birthdate" feature.</p>
